# DiscordBot
A multifunction discord bot. The bot offers moderation functions such as kicking and banning members
music functions for when people are in voice channels to enjoy some music, a fully functioning ticket
system with different categories depending on what issue the user has, announcements, polls & suggestions
and more!
# Prerequisites
Don't forget to create a .env file in the main directory in which you will store the bot token as well as the prefix. Example:

``PREFIX = !``

You can also change the prefix to your desired one.
